Drug repurposing or repositioning is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of the original medical indication.  In our present work, we looked for drug repurposing opportunities towards Alzheimer's disease, or AD, whith a computational network pharmacology technique that scores drugs based on their network topological proximity to disease genes.  We evaluated network proximity scores for some twenty four hundred drugs and eight AD gene sets containing long-established, knowledge based, AD genes as well as AD genes emerging from recent multi-omic studies.

We selected three top-ranked drugs from the network proximity screen (drugs A, B and C) and investigated them experimentally in model systems relevant to AD.  Drug C was tested in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD and was found to prevent the increase of plasma Nfl.  Drugs A, B and C were each tested in 33 cell-based assays.  Bayesian analysis of dose-response relationships revealed that both drug A and C inhibit neuroinflammation and promote amyloid-beta clearance and drug C also inhibited amyloid-beta release. Taken together, our experimental findings warrant a further investigation of the possibility of repurposing drugs A and C to AD.
