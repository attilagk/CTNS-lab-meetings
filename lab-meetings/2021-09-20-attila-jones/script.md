## DREAM

Our group is working on study we call DREAM.  The idea is to repurpose drugs to Alzheimer's that have been developed and approved for other indications.  To this end our group previously used metabolomics but this talk presents our more recent research project that is driven by genomics.  This new project begins with the collection of AD genes.  We will distinguish AD risk genes from AD associated genes.  While both type are statistically associated to AD, AD risk genes play mechanistic role in AD pathology, while AD associated genes not necessarily, and in fact most of them do not.

To collect AD genes we use curated knowledge...

...our own proteomic studies on AD genes...

...public omic data...

...and association resources.

Second, we plan to search for AD drug candidates among all approved drugs given our collection of AD genes both by a what we call the shared gene approach taken by Anjali...

...and a network approach taken by me...

Third, we plan to validate those drug candidates with in vitro essays and pharmacoepidemiology.

## Drug repurposing

The idea of drug repurposing is to take a drug that has been developed and approved for some indication X and use some approach to evaluate its potential for Alzheimer's.

The shared gene approach to repurposing looks at targets of drugs approved for indication X.  These targets are genes associated to X.  If a target is also associated to AD then the approach nominates the corresponding drug for repurposing to AD.  An example is drug A and its target t_A1.

This approach is simple and sensitive as it considers thousands of genes that are statistically associated to AD.  Such statistical associations include two classes of genes.  One is a large class of AD associated genes that are without a mechanistic link to AD and therefore inefficient for AD treatment; examples include genes in linkage disequilibrium with causal variants, or genes mentioned in the context of AD in the corpus of scientific literature. The other, smaller, class of AD associated genes are mechanistically linked to AD by either being an AD risk gene or interacting with one.  Targeting these latter class of genes is what we seek.  However, the shared gene approach cannot distinguish between the two classes of genes.

The network approach, in contrast, can make such distinction since it allows us to estimate the strength of a mechanistic link between a drug and AD pathology by calculating the distance between the drug's targets and the AD risk genes.  The mechanistic insight comes from the fact that distance is defined on the topology of the vast gene network of the interactome.  This enhances specificity, which in turn helped validation of this approach by pharmacoepidemiology.

I will now let Anjali present her results obtained with the shared gene approach and I will come back afterwards to talk more about the network approach and present a pilot study.

## Drug repurposing

Let's return to the network approach and see how it quantifies a given drug's repurposing potential for AD!

## Quantifying repurposing potential in a toy network

To demonstrate this we use a toy gene network with three disease genes B, D, E.  The nodes of this network represent genes and the edges represent interactions between genes.  Genes may be connected to each other via paths of one or more edges.  For example the shortest path connecting gene B and E is of length 2.

Suppose a given drug targets both E, itself a disease gene, and J, a gene directly interacting with a disease gene so intuitively we expect this drug to have a relatively strong repurposing potential.

This expectation can be quantified by the raw distance.  To calculate raw distance we take the length of the shortest path connecting each target to the closest disease gene, then we average these length values.  For target J the path length to the closest gene (which is B) is 1; while for target E it is zero since E doubles as a disease gene.  So the raw distance is 0.5.

Is this distance significantly shorter than randomly picking two other targets in this toy network? To answer that we calculate a Z score that compares the raw distance to the null distribution of distances generated by many random picks.  This standardization removes much of the bias that is introduced by the varying node degree, that is the varying number of interaction partners of both the drug targets and that of the disease genes.  For instance gene B has five interaction partners while gene E only three; thus in principle individual interactions have more impact on E than on B.  The Z score corrects for that.

Once we have the Z score it is straight forward to transform it to a p value.  In the present example p is 0.3.  This suggests that although the raw distance between the drug targets and disease genes is small, it is not small enough given the tiny size of the toy network.

Let's take another drug with targets C and H.  These new targets seem to be further away from the red disease genes than the previous targets.  Indeed the raw distance, the z score and p value are all much greater than those for the previous targets, which confirms our intuition.

## The real data

Now let's turn to our real world gene network, the human interactome.  It has nearly quarter of a million interactions (edges) between nearly 20 thousands genes.  As the first approximation to AD risk genes we took AD genes from knowledge bases such as UniProt KB.  Imagine this small set of twenty-six genes in the vast human interactome.  It turns out that their node degree (that is the number of interaction partners) varies greatly: on the one extreme we have APP with more than a thousand interactions, on the other extreme UNC3C with just 4 interactions.  Recall that our network approach takes this into account.

Before we scored drugs given this network and AD risk gene set we arbitrary selected 3 AD genes as positive controls.  The idea is that if there was a drug targeting these 3 AD genes that drug should have a strong repurposing potential and thus should have significantly small network based distance to AD genes.

## Quantifying repurposing potential in a toy gene network

Next we scored the 3 arbitrary selected AD genes and compared them to seven sets of drug targets in the pilot phase of our network based drug screen.  The first set of genes---TLR7, TLR9 and ACE2---are targeted by Hydroxychloroquine, a drug studied by our group recently.  The remaining six sets of targets each contain a single gene and were implicated by another recent study from our group on the genetics shared by asthma and Alzheimer's disease.

It is important to note that, although they might be statistically associated to AD, none of the targets are part of our stringently defined knowledge based AD risk gene set.  Therefore we expect the network approach to give them weaker score relative to the 3 AD genes.  Indeed this is what we observe: we obtained zero distance, very low z score and p value for the 3 AD genes but not for the rest.

## AD risk genes suggested by several TWAS

In this pilot study we wanted to extend the knowledge based AD risk gene set with likely AD risk genes suggested by recent omic studies.  TWAS or transcriptome wide association studies and other fine mapping methods are designed to identify genes that are causal to disease.  We collected 9 gene sets inferred by various TWAS to play a causal role in Alzheimer's.  The methodological details of these TWAS varied greatly, which explains the small overlap between the gene sets shown by the clustered-heatmap.  To ensure high specificity, we considered further only those AD risk genes that were inferred by two or more studies; these are marked green on the histogram.  We call the set of these high confidence AD risk genes TWAS2+.

## Extending the knowledge based AD risk gene set

The Venn diagram shows the knowledge based and TWAS2+ AD risk gene set.  The third gene set, IAPS is the incipient AD proteomic signature that our group's latest published proteomic study found to be differentially expressed in young APOE carriers and as such may be mechanistically linked to AD pathogenesis.

## Quantifying repurposing potential in a toy gene network

The orange symbols compare results under the extended AD risk gene set.  We see that the results changed relative to the knowledge only AD risk gene set.  The change is either because one of the TWAS2+ or IAPS genes is closer to the target than any of the knowledge based genes; see ADRB2 for example.  Or the change is due to the larger AD gene set size and different degree distribution, see ILR6 for instance.

## DREAM

This is where we are.  We are working towards scoring all approved drugs in the drug bank...

...to prioritize them for experimental validation.

## Summary

In summary Anjali and I talked about two approaches to evaluating drugs' potential for repurposing to AD.  The shared gene approach is simple and sensitive as it considers thousands of genes statistically associated to AD but its specificity is likely quite low.  The network approach aims at high specificity by focusing on molecular mechanisms.  With the shared gene approach we already obtained some AD drug candidates.  On the other hand, completed only the pilot phase using the network approach.
