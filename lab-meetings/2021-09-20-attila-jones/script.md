## DREAM

Our group is working on study we call DREAM.  The idea is to repurpose drugs to Alzheimer's that have been developed and approved for other indications.  First, we plan we collect AD genes. By "AD genes" we mean genes that are not merely associated to but also causal to Alzheimer's.  Keep in mind that the vast majority of disease associated genes are not causal.

To collect AD genes we use curated knowledge...

...our own proteomic studies on AD genes...

...and public omic data.

Second, we plan to prioritize all approved drugs given our collection of AD genes.  The approach I am taking uses the vast network of the human interactome.  This will yield AD drug candidates.

Third, we plan to validate those drug candidates with in vitro essays and pharmacoepidemiology.

## Drug repurposing

The idea of drug repurposing is to take a drug that has been developed and approved for some indication X and somehow evaluate its potential for Alzheimer's.  One approach to repurposing is to test whether a given drug targets a gene that is causal to both indication X and AD
