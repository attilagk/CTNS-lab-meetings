\section{Introduction}

Late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most
common form of dementia affecting a growing number of individuals in ageing
societies for which effective treatments are
unavailable~\citep{Bondi2017,Masters2015}.  Repurposing drugs approved for other indications is
a promising approach  towards identification of effective disease-modifying AD
treatments~\citep{Pushpakom2019,Fang2021,Taubes2021}.  One of the key
milestones of the National Plan for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease is to ``Initiate
research programs for translational bioinformatics and network pharmacology to
support rational drug repositioning''~\citep{Aging}.

Although a few major genetic risk factors for AD are known---most importantly
the $\epsilon 3$ and $\epsilon 4$ alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE3, APOE4,
respectively) \cite{Yamazaki2019}---our understanding of the early etiological
triggers of the disease is still limited.  Reasons include the great genetic
and cellular complexity of AD, and the confounding of the early etiology by
compensatory and degenerative pathologies over the decades-long disease
progression~\citep{DeStrooper2016}.  In this work we attempted to address this
challenge in two ways.  Firstly, we derive plausible mechanistic insights into
AD from previous genome-, transcriptome- and proteome-wide association studies
(GWAS, TWAS,
PWAS)~\citep{Jansen2019,Kunkle2019,Gerring2020,Baird2021,Schwartzentruber2021,Wightman2021,Wingo2021}
comparing AD and control samples, including analyses of differentially
expressed genes expression (DEGs) in APOE3/3 versus APOE4/4 individuals as
well as from comparison of DEGs in iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes and
microglia from APOE3/3 versus APOE4/4
individuals~\citep{Taubes2021,Lin2018}~(Fig.~\ref{fig:workflow}A).

  hand, drugs 1--3 only target genes at least three interactions away from AD
  genes and therefore are likely not efficient for AD.

\end{figure}

Secondly, we exploit rich, mechanistic information represented by two
interconnected networks (Fig~\ref{fig:workflow}B): (1) the network formed by
all drugs and their target genes (drug-target network) and (2) the human
gene-gene interaction network (known as the interactome), whose Alzheimer's
disease module~\citep{Barabasi2011} is defined by AD genes, a set of genes
mechanistically involved in AD.  Given these networks, we estimate the
efficacy of each drug for AD by evaluating network
proximity~\citep{Guney2016}, which is based on the drug's network topological
distance from the AD module.  Network proximity was shown~\citep{Cheng2018} to
be a powerful, systems-level, alternative to merely
correlative approaches to computational drug repurposing such as the
connectivity map, CMap~\citep{Lamb2006}.  We present the results and
computational validation of our network proximity based drug screen as well as
experimental validation of selected top ranking drugs, which we nominate as
candidate AD treatments.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Computational drug screen: evaluating network proximity}

Drugs with low network proximity score for any given set of disease genes were
previously shown to be good candidates for repurposing to that
disease~\citep{Cheng2018}.  We performed a network proximity based drug
repurposing screen for AD on 2413 drugs from ChEMBL either approved by the FDA
or in phase 3 clinical trials for any indication (Fig.~\ref{fig:workflow}A).  For each drug we
computed eight values of network proximity given eight sets of AD genes that
we derived from eight complementary information sources (one curated, knowledge
based source and seven multi-omic sources, Table~\ref{tab:genesets}).  This
resulted in eight distinct lists of the same 2413 drugs ranked according to
increasing network proximity (Fig.~\ref{fig:workflow}A) so that top ranking
drugs could be promising candidates for repurposing in AD.

\caption{
AD gene sets used as inputs to drug repurposing screens of this study.  For
the TWAS2+ gene set we combined gene sets from the TWAS of
\cite{Gerring2020,Baird2021,Jansen2019,Kunkle2019,Wingo2021,Schwartzentruber2021}
as well as from our own TWAS (Methods).  The genes in each set are listed in
Table~S\ref{tab:genes-in-genesets}.
}
\label{tab:genesets}
\end{table}

Although the eight input AD gene sets had little overlap with each other
(Fig.~\ref{fig:screen}A), the resulting eight vectors of network proximity had
markedly high correlations (Fig.~\ref{fig:screen}B) so that the eight lists of
drug rankings shared substantial similarity (Fig.~\ref{fig:screen}C right).
This suggests that even though the input AD gene sets share only a few genes,
the corresponding network modules are close enough to one another in network
topological space to exhibit similar network proximity to any given drug.

\label{fig:screen}
\end{figure}

Assuming our eight input AD gene sets were all equally relevant to Alzheimer's
disease, we aggregated the corresponding drug rankings giving uniform weight
to all gene sets.  This yielded a single final ranked list of the top 605
drugs (Fig.~\ref{fig:screen}C, Table~S\ref{tab:genes-in-genesets}).  The very top
ranked ($\le 30$) drugs on the final list also tended to be top ranked on five
out of eight input rankings (Fig.~\ref{fig:screen}D,
Fig.~S\ref{fig:rank-diff}).

\subsection{Computational validation}

To validate our network based screen we asked to what extent the top ranked
drugs were enriched in drugs already investigated or approved for AD.  To that
end we examined the rediscovery rate for the top-$t$ drugs relative to that
for the bottom-$1808$ drugs (see Methods for definitions).
Fig.~S\ref{fig:ad-drug-rediscovery} shows that rediscovery rate for the
top-$t$ drugs was about $2-3$-fold relative to that for the bottom drugs
depending on the threshold $t$.  This finding validates our approach.

We then re-evaluated rediscovery rate using the same drug ranking as above but
this time we queried the rediscovery of drugs approved (or in phase 3 trials)
for some other common indication rather than for AD.  There was sufficient
data (number of drugs) for 35 common indications (besides AD).  Several, but
not all, of these indications showed a similar enrichment pattern
(Fig.~S\ref{fig:ad-drug-rediscovery-multi}) to what we found earlier for AD
(Fig.~S\ref{fig:ad-drug-rediscovery}).  Interestingly, our drug ranking geared
towards AD tended to rediscover drugs developed for various forms of neoplasm
and cancer while failed to rediscover drugs for neuropsychiatric indications
like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and major depressive disorder
(Fig.~S\ref{fig:ad-drug-rediscovery-multi}).  These findings suggest that the
novel candidate drugs for AD from our network based screen tend to target some
molecular mechanism(s) targeted by previous anti-cancer drugs rather than
drugs used for neurological disorders.

We also checked the agreement between our network proximity based results
above and the results we obtained by using CMap with the same input AD gene
set.  Strikingly, we found no agreement between the two even when we
conditioned on the various cell types of the CMap data set
(Fig.~S\ref{fig:proxim-cmap},~S\ref{fig:proxim-cmap-celltype}).  Moreover,
different implementations of CMap yielded considerably different results
(Fig.~S\ref{fig:cmap-cmap}).  Given these conflicting observations and the
more realistic, systems-based, mechanistic modeling assumptions behind the
network approach, we did not analyze the results obtained with CMap any
further.

\subsection{Selected top ranking drugs}

We selected four top ranking compounds for further investigation
(Table~\ref{tab:selected-drugs}) based on evidence from \emph{in vivo} animal
experiments or cell based assays that suggest applicability to AD and other
neurodegenerative diseases (below).

Arundine, also known as 3,3-diindolylmethane, is the dimeric product of the
natural product indole-3-carbinol.  While Arundine has been mostly
investigated in the context of drug resistant tumors~\citep{Biersack2020}, its
close analogs have been found to cross the blood-brain barrier and protect
mice from MPTP-induced neurotoxicity and
neurodegeneration~\citep{DeMiranda2013} by suppressing
gliosis~\citep{DeMiranda2014}, a key hallmark of AD~\citep{DeStrooper2016}.
Moreover, Arundine was shown to inhibit oxidative stress induced apoptosis in
hippocampal neuronal cells~\citep{Lee2019} and protected primary hippocampal
cell cultures from ischemia induced apoptosis and
autophagy~\citep{Rzemieniec2019}.  Interestingly, the latter effect was found
to depend on Arundine binding to the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor, product of the
AHR gene,~\citep{Rzemieniec2019} which was found to be a target of Arundine in
mouse but has not yet been confirmed in humans and consequently was not taken
into account in our human-centered network proximity based drug screen.
Therefore, the Arundine-AHR interaction represents an additional piece of
evidence for the potential utility of Arundine in AD treatment.

One of the Arundine target that our analysis accounted for is the RGS4 gene
(regulator of G-protein signalling 4). RGS4 is notable
because it is also targeted by Chenodiol, another of our selected top-ranking
drugs.  Chenodiol, or Chenodeoxycholic acid, has been shown to be
neuroprotective in Huntington's disease~\citep{Keene2002}.  Moreover,
Chenodiol is a bile acid, and thus plausibly linked to
AD based on recent evidence by us and others~\citep{Varma2021,Baloni2020}.

Our third and fourth selected top drugs were Cysteamine and Cysteamine-HCl.
Cysteamine, whose targets also include RGS4, a derivative of the amino acid
cysteine.  Cysteamine can traverse the blood brain barrier, was approved for
cystinosis and eye diseases (MeSH:D005128), and more recently it has been
extensively investigated as a potential drug for neurodegenerative diseases,
specifically Huntingon's and Parkinson's diseases due to its neuroprotective
activity~\citep{Besouw2013,Paul2019}.  Previous evidence for Cysteamine's
potential utility for AD includes its favorable effect on the impaired
cognitive abilities of APP-Psen1 mice~\citep{Cicchetti2019}.

%\subsection{Molecular pathways from the selected drugs to AD genes}
\subsection{Hypothetical molecular pathways linking selected drugs to AD}

Next we aimed at elucidating hypothetical, AD-relevant molecular mechanisms of
the selected drugs.  We searched for all shortest pathways from each selected
drug to each AD gene set in the same interactome and drug-target network that
we used for our network proximity based drug screen.  The shortest path
length, defined as the least number of gene-gene interactions connecting a
given target to a given AD gene, ranged typically from 2 to 4 for most
combinations of target and AD gene set
(Fig.~S\ref{fig:shortest-path-lengths}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{../../results/2022-09-26-selected-drugs/knowledge-dtn.sif.pdf}
\caption{Hypothetical molecular mechanisms linking drugs (red nodes), targets
  (salmon nodes) and AD genes (light blue nodes).  Targets interact with AD
  genes via mediators (salmon) like UBC (ubiquitin C), EGFR, or CALM1
  (calmodulin 1).  Such target$\rightarrow$mediator$\rightarrow$AD gene paths
  are highlighted with colored, thick edges.
}
\label{fig:drug-AD-genes-network}
\end{figure}

We primarily focused on paths of length 2 as these are both short enough and
were found frequent enough (Fig.~S\ref{fig:shortest-path-lengths}) to explain
a drug's hypothetical protective effect for AD.  Such paths have the form:
$\mathrm{target} \rightarrow \mathrm{mediator} \rightarrow \mathrm{AD gene}$,
where \emph{mediator} is a gene transmitting the drug's effect between a target
and an AD gene (Fig.~\ref{fig:drug-AD-genes-network} thick, colored edges).
The mediator interacting with the most AD genes is UBC encoding Ubiquitin C
(Fig.~\ref{fig:drug-AD-genes-network} green edges, Table
S\ref{tab:mediators}). Mediator UBC interacts both with the Cysteamine target
CYP3A4 and with the Chenodiol target SLC10A2.  Target CYP3A4 has serveral
other mediators that interact with multiple AD genes: ubiquitin ligases STUB1
and AMFR as well as PRKCA/PRKACA encoding for subunits of protein kinase-C
(Table S\ref{tab:mediators}, Fig.~\ref{fig:drug-AD-genes-network}).

Mediators for RGS4 include receptor tyrosine protein kinases EGFR and ERBB3,
as well as CALM1 (calmodulin 1), COPB1 (coatomer protein complex subunit
$\beta$), and genes encoding for various G protein subunits (Table
S\ref{tab:mediators}, Fig.~\ref{fig:drug-AD-genes-network}).  Among these
mediators EGFR interacts with the most AD genes, including well-established
knowledge based AD genes of crucial relevance to AD: APP (amyloid precursor
protein, amyloid-$\beta$), MAPT (tau), SNCA---$\alpha$-synuclein
(Fig.~\ref{fig:drug-AD-genes-network}); also including AD genes strongly
supported by functional genomics studies (TWAS2+ AD gene set): PICALM and
PTK2B.

A few paths were of the form $\mathrm{target} \rightarrow \mathrm{AD gene}$
(path length 1).  This was the case only for target RGS4 and 4 genes in 4
relatively large AD gene sets (Table~S\ref{tab:nearest-ADgenes}).  Three of
these four genes---ERBB3, GNAI2, CALM1---were noted above as mediators in the
context of other, smaller, AD gene sets.  Moreover, RGS4 was found to be an AD
gene itself (path length$=0$) that belongs to the two largest AD gene sets
(Table~S\ref{tab:nearest-ADgenes}).

(Note to Madhav: although you asked me to move the next paragraph to
Discussion, I would still keep it here because I already recapitulated and
expanded on it in the Discussion.)

These observations altogether suggest that the selected drugs might modulate
multiple key AD genes through several molecular mechanisms: (1)
ubiquitination, (2) protein kinase-C dependent phosphorylation, (3) receptor
tyrosine kinase-dependent and (4) G-protein dependent signal transduction, (5)
Ca$^{2+}$-calmodulin, and (5) the coatomer complex.  We shall return to the
relevance of these mechanisms to AD in the present Discussion.

\subsection{Experimental validation}

We performed cell based phenotypic assays to investigate the utility of three
of the four selected drugs introduced above: Arundine, Chenodiol and
Cysteamine-HCl (Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-based-assays}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../../notebooks/2022-09-21-cell-based-assays/named-figure/cell-based-assays-simplified.pdf}
\caption{Results of cell-based assays: testing AD-relevant protective effects of three
  selected top drugs from the present computational screen: Chenodiol,
  Cysteamine-HCl (shortened to ``Cysteamine'' in this figure), and Arundine.

  $p \ge 0.05$, yellow), or significantly protective (green) or adverse (red).
  %TODO: ask Tina about details: Throughout panels A-H tested drug

  F) Assays of cell death, viability and apoptosis in response to trophic

\label{fig:cell-based-assays}
\end{figure}


Amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) clearance in BV2 cells was improved by both
Arundine and Chenodiol (Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-based-assays}A).
Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-based-assays}B shows that secretion of all three A$\beta$
species tested in H4 cells was significantly decreased by both Arundine and
Chenodiol (Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-based-assays}B); Cysteamine-HCl, on the other
hand, decreased only one species (A$\beta$1-42).  Neither Tau phosphorylation,
measured as pTau231 level, nor total Tau was significantly changed
(Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-based-assays}C).  The same conclusion is supported by
Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-based-assays}H showing unchanged Tau aggregation in a
cell-free assay. BV2 cells were protected from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
induced neuroinflammation by Chenodiol as measured by the MTT assay
(Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-based-assays}D).  On the other hand, Arundine was the only
drug that protected cells from LPS-induced TNF-$\alpha$ increase
(Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-based-assays}D).  In the same neuroinflammation model,
interleukins (IL-10, IL-1b, IL-6) were not changed by any of the drugs except
for a weakly significant increase by Chenodiol
(Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-based-assays}D).  Only Arundine protected primary neurones
from any trophic factor withdrawal (PI cell death,
Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-based-assays}F); in contrast, Chenodiol and Cysteamine-HCl
actually promoted certain aspects of cell death (LDH, MTT,
PI~Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-based-assays}F).  Finally, none of the drugs impacted
various assays of neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth in primary cultured
neurons (Fig.~\ref{fig:cell-based-assays}e).

\section{Discussion}

We have presented here novel repurposing opportunities for AD using evidence
from network pharmacology analyses, which showed that Arundine, Chenodiol and
Cysteamine act proximally to established AD genes in the human interactome of
genes.  In agreement with this, we found experimental support in cell based
essays for several neuroprotective properties of Arundine and Chenodiol.  Our
present work also reveals several plausible molecular mechanisms for these
drugs' hypothetical neuroprotective action in AD.  All three potential AD drugs
target RGS4 (Regulator Of G-Protein Signalling 4).  RGS4 was found to be
associated with schizophrenia~\citep{Chowdari2002}, one of the best
genetically characterized neuropsychological disorder, which shares
substantial heritability with AD~\citep{Consortium2018} and in which, like in
AD, autoimmune pathways have been found to play significant
nrole~\citep{Sekar2016a}.  Moreover, RGS4 is among the few hundred
differentially expressed genes in human brains affected by AD
\cite{Taubes2021}.

Our network analysis revealed the receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR as the key
molecular link between RGS4 and crucial AD genes like APP (producing
A$\beta$), MAPT (tau), SNCA ($\alpha$-synuclein) and PICALM.  Interaction
between RGS4 and EGFR might play a role in the known crosstalk between EGFR
and GPCRs~\cite{Wang2016c}.  Moreoveer, EGFR's driver role in several forms of
cancer~\cite{Sigismund2018} meshes with our current finding that our present
drug repurposing screen tended to rediscover drugs previously tested or
approved not only for AD but also for various neoplasms and cancers.  While
the network proximity based screen in this study suggested EGFR as a novel
regulator of previously known AD genes, at the time of our analyses there was
little additional evidence for this notion.  A more recent GWAS, however,
discovered AD-associated SNPs regulating EGFR expression, establishing EGFR as
a novel AD gene~\cite{Bellenguez2022}.  One of those SNPs, rs76928645, was
found to be associated also to the thalamus' volume, which provides a genetic
link between brain shrinkage and cognitive decline in
AD~\cite{Elvsaashagen2021}.  Besides EGFR, our network analysis implicates
other genes, notably CALM1 (calmodulin 1), that link drug target gene RGS4 to
key AD genes.  Binding of calmodulin to ryanodine receptor was recently found
to be neuroprotective in AD~\cite{Nakamura2021}.

AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) is known as another target of Arundine.
Evidence for this comes exclusively from animal experiments, hence
Arundine--AHR binding was not included in our drug--target network (Methods)
underlying our network based drug screen.  Still, AHR might be another drug
target highly relevant to AD because the Arundine--AHR interaction was shown
to protect cultured neurons in an experimental model for chronic
neuroinflammatory diseases like AD or Parkinson's
disease~\cite{Rzemieniec2019}.  We also found that SLC10A2 and
CYP3A4---targeted by Chenodiol and Cysteamine, respectively---might transmit
drug action to AD genes through mechanisms of ubiquitination and, in the case
of CYP3A4, through PKC-dependent phosphorylation, where both mechanisms have
been implicated in AD and related
phenotypes~\cite{Reis2022,Hegde2019,Alfonso2016}.

Computational drug repurposing is a new, rapidly evolving field without
established standards and with a multitude of varied approaches applicable to
a growing, diverse multi-omic body of data and curated
knowledge~\citep{Pushpakom2019}.  During our present investigations two drug
repurposing studies on AD were published: \cite{Fang2021} nominated sildenafil
while~\cite{Taubes2021} bumetanide.  These two works differed both in their
definition of AD genes as well as in the approach used to score and rank
drugs: \cite{Taubes2021} analyzed APOE genotype-specific DEGs with
CMap~\citep{Lamb2006}, while \cite{Fang2021} used knowledge-based AD genes, as
well as DEGs without known APOE genotype, as inputs to a network proximity
based drug repurposing screen~\citep{Cheng2018}.  In this paper we show that,
while the input gene sets have considerable effect on network proximity based
drug scores, the latter still show significant correlation.  Surprisingly, we
also find that the network proximity approach taken by \cite{Fang2021} and
CMap used by \cite{Taubes2021} leads to fully discordant, uncorrelated
results.  Moreover, we find that various published implementation of CMap lead
to quite different, albeit still correlated, results.  These observations
caution about methodological details.

Although the present study shares several methodological limitations with
those of \cite{Fang2021,Taubes2021}, we may argue to have carried out the most
carefully designed drug repurposing screen to date on AD.  We based our screen
on a diverse collection of AD gene sets that included a curated knowledge
based gene set, meta-analyzed, aggregated gene sets from TWAS and PWAS as well
as DEG sets from transcriptomic studies controlling for APOE genotype and
other genetic factors~\citep{Lin2018}.  These varied AD gene sources are
expected to introduce markedly varying bias into our drug repurposing screen: for
instance, the TWAS based gene set is small as it only contains genes with
strong statistical evidence for causal involvement in AD but likely misses
many other causal genes, while the DEG sets are large and likely inflated with
many genes that are not causal to AD.  It is easy to see how combination of
such diverse gene sets prior to the screen may further worsen the associated
biases. To prevent that, we conducted multiple screens, each conditioned on a
gene set and performed \emph{a posteriori} rank aggregation.  The rank
aggregation strategy also revealed that even some non-overlapping AD gene sets
resulted lead to the discovery of highly overlapping sets of very top drugs
demonstrating the robustness of our workflow.  Notably, the non-neuronal
AD gene sets were exception of this tendency pointing at the value of further
characterization of non-neuronal cells in
AD~\citep{Lopes2022,Mathys2019,DeStrooper2016}.

%Our computational validation, based on the rediscovery of drugs previously
%developed or repurposed for AD, revealed the enrichment of our top ranked
%drugs for also some common non-AD indications.  Genetic correlations between
%disease phenotypes~\citep{Consortium2018}, market-driven selection biases, and
%other factors may underlie not only this observation but also the known
%comorbidities of AD~\citep{Santiago2021}.  Such overlap between different
%drugs' indications is also consistent with the known relationship between drug
%repurposing and side effects~\citep{Ye2014}.  Further research is needed to
%dissect relationships between genetic correlations, comorbidities, side
%effects, protein and gene network topology, etc to be able to harness these and
%integrate into drug repurposing techniques.  That, in combination with
%expanding multi-celltype, multi-omic characterization of AD and its molecular
%subtypes~\citep{Neff2021}, will herald a new generation of drugs for
%Alzheimer's disease.

Even though this work utilizes extensive molecular knowledge on AD
pathomechanism, drug-target interactions, and gene-gene interactions, some
methodological limitations call for future studies.  Ever larger GWAS and
functional genomic studies will continue discovering AD genes with increasing
accuracy.  But the conceptual challenge for network pharmacology and
computational drug repurposing is to model AD more realistically.  This
involves observing and accurately modeling decade-long disease
progression~\cite{Kuo2022,IturriaMedina2022}, AD
subtypes~\citep{Neff2021}, metabolic pathways~\cite{Varma2021a}, cell type
specific AD pathways~\citep{Mathys2019,Neff2021}, interactions between cells
of various types~\citep{DeStrooper2016}, and mechanisms shared with other
diseases~\citep{Consortium2018,Santiago2021}.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{AD gene sets}

Given an AD gene set, the network structure of the human interactome, and
another network formed by drugs and their targets (drug-target network), the
topological proximity of a given drug to the AD gene set can be
quantified\citep{Guney2016} and used as evidence for repurposing that drug for
AD.  Rather than compiling a single AD gene set from multiple studies, we
opted for evaluating the proximity of any drug separately for multiple AD gene
sets and aggregate the multiple proximity values subsequently (see
Discussion).  Table~\ref{tab:genesets} summarizes the AD gene sets used in
this study.  The genes contained in each set are listed in Table~S1.

\subsection{Previous and novel TWAS on AD}

We obtained AD gene sets from multiple TWAS.  Besides collecting AD genes from
previous transcriptome- and proteome-wide association studies (TWAS, PWAS) we
conducted our own applying the S-MultiXcan approach~\citep{Barbeira2018} to
the two largest AD-GWAS to date~\citep{Schwartzentruber2021,Wightman2021}.
S-MultiXcan borrows statistical strength from multiple tissue types; we used a
predictive model of gene expression built on all tissues of the GTEx data set
or on only brain tissues.

We conservatively took the top 30 genes and investigated their agreement with
top gene sets from seven previous TWAS and one previous PWAS (see Table~S2
listing genes contained in each set).  Hierarchical clustering of studies
based on shared genes (Fig.~S\ref{fig:twas-clustermap}) showed a fairly low
agreement for all pairs of studies.  The most similar study pair was our
present TWAS and the fine mapping of~\cite{Jansen2019} despite several
methodological differences between these two studies, which helps validate our
novel TWAS results.  As might be expected, the least similarity was found
between the only PWAS in our collection and all the other studies.

\subsection{Drug-target network}

We queried ChEMBL~\citep{Gaulton2017} (v29, July 2021) for phase 3 and 4 drugs
and those of their targets that satisfied the following conditions: (1) the
target is a human protein (2) its average $-\log_{10}\mathrm{Activity}$ or
$p\mathrm{Activity}$ is $\ge 5$, which corresponds to $\le 10 \mu M$
following~\cite{Cheng2018}.  Average $p\mathrm{Activity}$ activity is defined
as $\sum_{i=1}^n p\mathrm{Activity}_i \ge 5$, where $n$ is the number of
activity measurements for a given drug-protein pair and $\mathrm{Activity}_i$
is the standard value of the $i$-th measurement stored in the
activities.standard\_value SQL variable.  See
\href{https://github.com/attilagk/CTNS-notebook/blob/main/2021-10-24-chembl-query/drug_target_avg_activity.sql}{our SQLite script} for implementation.

\subsection{Gene-gene interaction network}

We used the network compiled by \cite{Cheng2019}, which consists 11133 nodes
(genes) and 217160 edges (gene-gene interactions).

\subsection{Network proximity calculations}

\cite{Guney2016} developed the network proximity method for in silico drug efficacy screening.  It
quantifies the topological proximity $d$ in the interactome of the set $T$ of a drug's target genes
to the set $S$ of disease genes: 

\begin{equation}
  d(S, T) = \frac{1}{|T|}\sum_{t \in T} \min_{s \in S} d(s, t)
\end{equation}
where $d(s,t)$ is the shortest path length between disease gene $s$ and drug
target $t$.  The equation can be interpreted as the average length of shortest
paths taken from all targets of a drug to all the disease genes.

We used \href{https://github.com/attilagk/guney_code}{our modified clone} of
the original, now obsolete, implementation of \cite{Guney2016}, which allows
running the code under Python~3.

\subsection{CMap analyses}

Since there are several implementations of CMap (Connectivity Map) analysis was carried out with several tools.  First, we used
\url{https://clue.io/} \citep{Lamb2006} and, for each drug, averaged
``norm\_cs'',
the normalized connectivity scores.  Second, we used L1000CDS$^2$ at
\url{https://maayanlab.cloud/L1000CDS2} and the averaged ``score'' variable.
Third, we used... TODO: ask Sudhir what implementation he used.

\subsection{Rank aggregation}

As Fig.~\ref{fig:workflow} shows, we aggregated 8 lists of network
proximity-ranked drugs into a single list with rank aggregation algorithms.
We performed rank aggregation with the TopKLists R package
%\citep{Schimek2015}
several times, each time with different algorithm.  Then we assessed those
algorithm's performance with Modified Kendall Distance and found the MC3
algorithm to perform the best (Fig.~S\ref{fig:kendall-dist}).  Finally, we
used the MC3-aggregated list in our workflow.

\subsection{Cell-based assays}

We tested whether our selected drugs can rescue molecular phenotypes relevant
to Alzheimer's disease including tau phosphorylation, A$\beta$1-42 clearance,
A$\beta$ secretion, A$\beta$ toxicity, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
neuroinflammation, cell death due to trophic factor withdrawal and neurite
outgrowth and neurogenesis~\citep{Varma2020,Desai2022a}. In all assays
described below, cells treated with drugs were compared to either the vehicle
control (VC) or lesion control.

Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism. Group differences
were evaluated for each test item separately by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test versus vehicle or
lesion control.

\subsubsection{A$\beta$ clearance}

For A$\beta$ clearance assay, 20,000 BV2 cells per well (uncoated 96-well
plates) were plated out. After changing cells to treatment medium, drug
compounds were administered 1 hour before A$\beta$ stimulation (Bachem,
4061966; final concentration in well, 200 ng/ml; dilutions in medium). Cells
treated with vehicle and cells treated with A$\beta$ alone served as controls.
After 3 hours of A$\beta$ stimulation, cell supernatants were collected for
the A$\beta$ measurement and cells were carefully washed twice with PBS and
thereafter lysed in 35 $\mu$l of cell lysis buffer (50 mM tris-HCl, pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 1\% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors.
Supernatants and cell lysates were analyzed for human A$\beta$42 with the MSD
V-PLEX Human A$\beta$42 Peptide (6E10) Kit (K151LBE, Mesoscale Discovery). The
immune assay was carried out according to the manual, and plates were read on
MESO QuickPlex SQ 120.

\subsubsection{A$\beta$ secretion}

H4-hAPP cells were cultivated in Opti-MEM supplemented with 10\% FCS, 1\%
penicillin/streptomycin, hygromycin B (200 $\mu$g/ml), and blasticidin S (2.5
$\mu$g/ml).  H4-hAPP cells were seeded into 96-well plates (2 $\times$ 104
cells per well). On the next day, cells in 96-well plates were treated with
compounds, reference item [400 nM
N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT)],
or vehicle. Twenty-four hours later, supernatants were collected for further
A$\beta$ measurements by MSD [V-PLEX A$\beta$ Peptide Panel 1 (6E10) Kit,
K15200E, Mesoscale Discovery].

\subsubsection{Tau phosphorylation}

SH-SY5Y-hTau441(V337M/R406W) cells were maintained in culture medium [DMEM
medium, 10\% FCS, 1\% nonessential amino acids (NEAA), 1\% l-glutamine,
gentamycin (100 $\mu$g/ml), and geneticin G-418 (300 $\mu$g/ml)] and
differentiated with 10 $\mu$M retinoic acid for 5 days changing medium every 2
to 3 days. Before the treatment, cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at a
cell density of 2 $\times$ 105 cells per well on day one of in vitro culture
(DIV1). Drug compounds were applied on DIV2. After 24 hours of incubation
(DIV3), cells on 24-well plates were harvested in 60 $\mu$l of RIPA buffer [50
mM tris (pH 7.4), 1\% NP-40, 0.25\% Na-deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA
supplemented with freshly added 1 $\mu$M NaF, 0.2 mM Na-orthovanadate, 80
$\mu$M glycerophosphate, protease (Calbiochem), and phosphatase
(Sigma-Aldrich) inhibitor cocktail]. Protein concentration was determined by
BCA assay (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and samples were adjusted to a
uniform total protein concentration. Total tau and phosphorylated tau were
determined by immunosorbent assay from Mesoscale Discovery
[Phospho(Thr231)/Total Tau Kit K15121D, Mesoscale Discovery].

\subsubsection{LPS-induced neuroinflammation}

The murine microglial cell line BV2 was cultivated in Dulbeccoâ€™s modified
Eagle's medium (DMEM) medium supplemented with 10\% fetal calf serum (FCS),
1\% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine (culture medium). For LPS
stimulation assay, 5000 BV2 cells per well (uncoated 96-well plates) were
plated out and the medium was changed to treatment medium (DMEM, 5\% FCS, and
2 mM l-glutamine). After changing cells to treatment medium, drug compounds
were administered 1 hour before LPS stimulation [Sigma-Aldrich; L6529; 1 mg/ml
stock in ddH2O; final concentration in well, 100 ng/ml (dilutions in medium)].
Cells treated with vehicle, cells treated with LPS alone, and cells treated
with LPS plus reference item (dexamethasone, 10 $\mu$M; Sigma-Aldrich, D4902)
served as controls. After 24 hours of stimulation, cell supernatants were
collected for the cytokine measurement (V-PLEX Proinflammatory Panel 1 Mouse
Kit, K15048D, Mesoscale) and cells were subjected to
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.

\subsubsection{Neurite outgrowth and neurogenesis}

Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from E18.5 timed pregnant
C57BL/6JRccHsd mice as previously described. Cells were seeded in
poly-D-lysine pre-coated 96-well plates at a density of 2.6 $\times$ 104
cells/well in medium (Neurobasal,
2\% B-27, 0.5 mM glutamine, 25 $\mu$M glutamate,
1\% Penicillinâ€“Streptomycin). Directly on DIV1, the drug of interest or VC was
applied. On DIV2, 10 $\mu$M Bromodeuxyuridine (BrdU; B5002 Sigma Aldrich) was
added and cells were fixed after additional 24h. Cells were permeabilized with
0.1\% Triton-X and incubated with primary Beta Tubulin Isotype III (T8660,
Sigma Aldrich) and BrdU antibodies (MAS25$\circ$C, AHrlan-Sera Lab) overnight
at 4$\circ$C. Afterwards, cells were washed two times with PBS and incubated
with fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies and DAPI for 1.5 h at room
temperature (RT) in the dark. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS and
imaged with the Cytation 5 Multimode reader (BioTek) at 10 $\times$
magnification (six images per well). BrdU-positive cells were counted as a
marker of neurogenesis and Beta Tubulin Isotype III signal was used for
macro-based quantification of neurite outgrowth.

\subsubsection{Trophic factor withdrawal}

Primary cortical neurons from embryonic day 18 (E18) C57Bl/6 mice were
prepared as previously described. On the day of preparation (DIV1), cortical
neurons were seeded on poly-d-lysine precoated 96-well plates at a density of
3 $\times$ 104 cells per well. Every 4 to 6 days, a half medium exchange using full
medium (Neurobasal, 2\% B-27, 0.5 mM glutamine, and 1\% penicillin-streptomycin)
was carried out. On DIV8, a full medium exchange to B-27 free medium
(Neurobasal, 0.5 mM glutamine, and 1\% penicillin-streptomycin) was performed
and drug compounds were applied thereafter. The experiment was carried out
with six technical replicates per condition, and vehicle-treated cells
served as control. After 28 hours on B-27â€“free medium, cells were subjected to
YO-PRO/propidium iodide (PI) and MTT as well as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
assay.
