\caption{Estimating the prior and posterior probability of the protective, neutral

  curves sampled from the prior or posterior distribution of model parameters.
  The desired direction of drug effect (decrease in this particular assay) and
  thresholds $t_1<1$ and $t_2>1$ together define the three hypotheses of
  interest: protective ($H_1$), neutral ($H_0$) and adverse ($H_2$) drug
  effect.  The average fold change of expected bioactivity $\mathrm{FC}_y$ at
  saturating concentration, $y_1=\mathrm{FC}_y y_0$, relative to the expected activity
  at zero drug concentration, $y_0$, is marked by a dashed horizontal line
  given a sample from the prior or posterior distribution.  (B) Prior and
  posterior probability density of fold change for the same drug and assay as
  in (A).  Observe how the posterior density is shifted towards the desired
  direction and has a decreased standard deviation (vertical error bar)
  relative to the prior density.  Note that the prior density (as well as
  $t_1, t_2$) was chosen such
  that the mean fold change is 1 and such that the prior probability of
  protective ($H_1$) and adverse ($H_2$) effect is both 0.2, whereas that of
