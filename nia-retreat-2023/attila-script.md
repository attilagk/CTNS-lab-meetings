Drug repurposing (also called drug repositioning, reprofiling or re-tasking) is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of the original medical indication.  In our present work we looked for drug repurposing opportunities towards Alzheimer's disease by combining computational network pharmacology with known AD risk genes from the latest genomic fine mapping studies.  Our network pharmacology procedure scored each of >2,000 drugs approved for non-AD indications.  The score quantifies the topological proximity, in the human interactome, of a given drug to a set of AD risk genes.

We selected three drugs with high proximity score that have been found to exert neuroprotective actions by previous studies.  Our network analysis revealed that the three drugs are connected to long-established AD risk genes like APP, tau, APOE, PSEN1-2, through mediator genes that were implicated in AD only by recent genomic studies.

We next performed experimental validation of the three selected drugs.  We found that two of the drugs had neuroprotective properties in cell based assays for amyloid-beta clearance and secretion.  In future research we are planning to subject these drugs to further experimental validation.
