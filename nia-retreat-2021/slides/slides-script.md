Hi I am Attila Jones, a new bioinformatic scientist in Madhav's group.  I am joining a planned study in which we seek drugs approved for any indication that might be repurposed for Alzheimer's disease.

We are starting this study by compiling Alzheimer's disease genes.  This is because any efficient drug must either directly or indirectly, that is: through protein-protein interactions, target an Alzheimer's disease gene.

Our initial disease gene set comes from three subsets.  First, we collected experimentally established Alzheimer's disease genes from knowledge bases like UniProt.  Second, we compiled likely Alzheimer's disease genes from several TWAS or transcriptome-wide association studies.  The third gene set came from our own recent study that describes an incipient Alzheimer's disease proteomic signature.  This work was presented earlier by Vijay from our group.

Next slide please.  This slide explains how the protein-protein interaction network can relate drug targets to disease genes and therefore guide drug repurposing. The figure comes from Cheng et al who reconstructed, in the vast protein-protein interaction network, relatively small clusters of disease genes known as disease modules.  The red module is for coronary artery disease (CAD) while the purple module is for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Cheng et al found that Hydroxychloroquine, a drug approved for malaria and rheumatoid arthritis, acts proximally to these two disease modules by targeting TLR7 and TLR9.  This suggested that the drug could be repurposed for coronary artery disease.  Indeed, Cheng et al successfully confirmed that in validation experiments.  Interestingly, Hydroxychloroquine popped up also in our recent work, which Vijay talked about.

We plan to use the network proximity approach to prioritize all approved drugs according to their repurposing potential for Alzheimer's disease.  We will then perform experimental validation as part of the DREAM prevent AD studies.  Furthermore, this network based approach might also clarify some patho-mechanisms of comorbidities at the molecular systems level.
